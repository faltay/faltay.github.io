## Hi there 👋

I'm a web designer and developer dedicated to creating clean, modern, and user-centered digital experiences. Over the years, I’ve worked with clients from various industries—designing intuitive interfaces, improving UX flows, and developing scalable websites that not only look good but also perform exceptionally well. I currently operate my own [web design agency](https://pixelica.net/web-design/), where I focus on delivering high-quality designs, responsive layouts, and development solutions tailored to each client’s business goals.

On the development side, I work extensively with PHP and specialize in building custom solutions as a [WordPress developer](https://pixelica.net/wordpress-development/). This includes theme development, plugin customization, performance optimization, SEO-friendly architecture, and fully tailored dashboards that give clients complete control over their content. My approach combines clean code, modular structures, and best practices to ensure every project is fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

As someone who values continuous improvement, I’m always experimenting with new tools, modern workflows, and innovative design systems. On GitHub, you’ll find my personal projects, libraries, and experiments that help streamline development processes and enhance UI/UX outcomes. I enjoy sharing what I learn, exploring new techniques, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of web design and development.

If you're interested in collaboration, need support on a design-driven project, or want a reliable developer for your next website, I’m always open to connecting. My goal is to create digital experiences that are visually compelling, technically efficient, and optimized for long-term success.
